# Sudoku
I have come up with the idea of creating a sudoku game when we where in school. We have as a school subject Java. When I was done with the homework of that subject I wanted to test my skills. Thats how this project started.

I enjoyed making this project. It showed me how JFrames and JPanels work in Java and it gave me a basic understanding of how a game is put together.

## Features
My Sudoku game has the following features:
- Timer which counts the time until finished
- Play and reset button to reset and start a new game
- Sudoku game itself, it uses a backtracking algoritme that firstly solves the sudoku and then removes random squares so you know that it is solvable
- Arrow navigation through the squares
- blue and red numbers to show if its a valid number or not
- Makes all the numbers red that correspond with the faulty number
- Win screen with the final time

## Technologies Used
This Sudoku game has been developed in **Java**

## How to Run the Project
1. Go to releases and get the latest release.
2. Download the `Sudoku.jar` file.
3. Run the file, enjoy playing!

**Be sure that you have Java installed on your machine**
